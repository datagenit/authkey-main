              <h2>What is WhatsApp Marketing?</h2>
              <p>
                WhatsApp marketing involves broadcasting messages on the
                WhatsApp to enhance brand value and increase organic
                conversions.
              </p>
              <p>
                WhatsApp marketing refers to sending bulk WhatsApp messages to
                build brand awareness, promote, advertise, and boost business
                sales. Businesses use WhatsApp to establish a digital connection
                with their audience for sharing product updates, sales offers,
                discounts, and notifications, etc. The marketing messages on
                WhatsApp have compelling content, images attachments, videos, or
                click-to-action (CTA) links to attract a wider audience.

                <p>
                  WhatsApp marketing helps businesses to engage customers
                  through promotional messages. It's crucial to maintain a
                  lasting customer relationship – a belief as once a customer,
                  always a customer in the future. Keep a separate database for
                  customers who have made purchases in the past. Use this data
                  to send targeted promotional campaigns before festive sales,
                  new arrivals, and offer loyalty points to bring best pricing.
                  Strengthen customer loyalty through strategic and personalized
                  WhatsApp messages.
