The US may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the US, we will safeguard it as described in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Service is hosted in the United States or Germany. Regardless of the database being hosted within the European Union, if you choose to use the Service from the EU or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from US law, please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in our Terms of Service. We will adhere to GDPR requirements to ensure adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the US. Additionally, we may transfer your data to the US, the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with data storage and processing to fulfill your requests and operate the Service.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Data Controller and Data Processor</h4>
                            <p>Authkey does not own, control, or directly oversee the utilization of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User through the Service. Only the Client or Users have the authority to access, retrieve, and govern the use of such Client Data. Authkey has limited awareness of the specific Client Data being stored or made accessible by a Client or User through the Service. Authkey does not directly access this Client Data except when authorized by the Client or when necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.
                            </p>
                            <p>As Authkey neither collects nor determines the usage of any Personal Data within the Client Data, and because it doesn't establish the purposes, methods of collection, or the uses of this Personal Data, Authkey is not operating as a data controller under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, "GDPR"). Thus, it does not carry the associated responsibilities stipulated by the GDPR. Authkey should be regarded solely as a data processor on behalf of its Clients and Users concerning any Client Data containing Personal Data that falls under the GDPR's requirements. Except as outlined in this Privacy Policy, Authkey does not independently facilitate the transfer or provision of Client Data containing Personal Data to third parties. This is only done through third-party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Authkey while delivering Services to Clients. Such actions are executed or authorized solely by the respective Client or User.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Client or the User, as per the Regulation, serves as the data controller for any Client Data containing Personal Data. This means that such a party governs the method by which Personal Data is collected and utilized, as well as determining the purposes and means of processing such Personal Data.
                            </p>
                            <p>Authkey is not accountable for the content of the Personal Data within the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or subcontractors' servers) based on the Client's or User's discretion. Authkey is also not responsible for how the Client or User manages, discloses, distributes, or otherwise processes such information.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Data Retention</h4>
                            <p>We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User’s account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ul className="listone">
                                <li>the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 6 months of the date of closure.</li>
                                <li>backups are kept for 2 months.</li>
                                <li>information on legal transactions between Client and Authkey is retained for a period of 5 years.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Third-party cookies</h3>
                            <p>We permit third parties, with whom we have a separate agreement, to use cookies and other technologies for collecting information about your use of the Site.

                            </p>
                            <p>We do not share any information that could readily identify you, such as your email address, with these third parties. However, these third parties may have access to information related to your device, like your IP or MAC address. We do not possess access to or control over the technologies these third parties use to gather information about your interests. The information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Apart from what is discussed in this document, we have no authority over these third parties.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
                            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and INDIA, and the concepts they encompass have played a significant role in shaping data protection laws worldwide. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how to implement them is crucial for compliance with the various privacy laws that safeguard personal information.
                            </p>
                            <p>To align with the Fair Information Practices, we will take the following responsive actions in the event of a data breach: We will notify you via email or through an in-site notification within 7 business days. We also commit to the Individual Redress Principle, which grants individuals the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to comply with the law. This principle not only ensures that individuals have enforceable rights against data users but also provides them with recourse to pursue legal action through courts or government agencies to investigate and prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
                            </p>
