              Two-factor authentication(2FA) is becoming increasingly obvious
              for passwords alone are not sufficient to adequately protect user

                    Each scope is tracked by hackers, and passwords are stored

                    Security solutions such as two-factor authentication (FFA)
                    have become increasingly important for retailers. FFA
                    enables retailers to authenticate their users' identities
                    when they access their networks from remote desktops or
                    mobile phones.

                    2FA is used by the banking industry to protect against the
                    many hacking attempts made on the banks' internal and
                    client's systems. Authkeyâ€™s OTP-based authentication has
                    proven helpful in improving the resilience of many large

                    Colleges,Universities and private institutions use 2FA to
                    secure their applications and student data. Institutions
                    handle thousands of sensitive user records, including
                    financial information. Hacking and malicious breaches of
                    security have been a problem for institutions with such
                    valuable data.

                    two-factor authentication (F2FA) on social media platforms

                    from hacking attempts on their internal networks, social
